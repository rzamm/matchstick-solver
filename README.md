# Matchstick Puzzle Solver

Can you move 8 matches from this layout and have the matches form 5 squares?<br>
<img src="/docs/img/1.png" alt="Challenge" width="400" height="400">

Try it yourself with some matches at home!

<!--suppress CheckImageSize -->
<details>
  <summary>Click here for a hint</summary>
  <p>
    Remove 4 matches from the middle and 4 from the sides.<br>
    The layout should look like this:<br>
    <img src="/docs/img/2.png" alt="Hint" width="300" height="300">
  </p>
</details>

It would be nice to have a tool for such problems, right?<br>
This project is for exactly that, it can find the solutions to any match problem.
When given an initial layout, the number of movable matches and how many squares there should be,
this tool will return all possible solutions that it can find.

To use this tool, simply build and run this on your machine.

For anyone interested, here is another challenge:
Move 6 matches and get 6 squares.<br>
